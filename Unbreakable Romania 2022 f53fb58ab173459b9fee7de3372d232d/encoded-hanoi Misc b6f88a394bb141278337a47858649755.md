Flag Proof: `CTF{c8690500015d8e4395c0459c24c6a79ac1d828dd4190eb48b958aaf57bda83f7}`

## Summary:

- It is a hanoi problem, which asks to move disks from one tower to another (took a script i found on some site and modified it)
- After manually doing it for the some time, first 2 rounds ask the same thing , then the 3rd ask also the same thing but with 5 disks, then the 4rd with the 7 disks

```python
from pwn import *

context.log_level = 'debug'

def TOH(source, auxiliary, destination, numOfDisk,r):
    #Base case of Recursion that when there is no disk to move then terminate the call.
    if numOfDisk > 0:
        #Recursively calling for moving n-1 disk from source
        #to auxiliary using destination. 
        TOH(source, destination, auxiliary, numOfDisk-1,r)

        #Moving the disk from source to destination
        r.sendline("Move the top disk of tower {0} to tower {1}".format(source, destination, auxiliary).encode())
        r.clean()
        #Recursively askting to move remaining disk from 
        #auxiliary to destination using source.
        TOH(auxiliary, source, destination, numOfDisk-1,r)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    r = remote("34.159.208.78",32254)
    r.clean(timeout=0.5)
    TOH(1,2,3,3,r)
    TOH(1,2,3,3,r)
    TOH(1,2,3,5,r)
    TOH(1,2,3,7,r)
```

- After solving them we get an base64 encoded string, decoding it also gives a base32 encoded string, decoding it gives the flag
