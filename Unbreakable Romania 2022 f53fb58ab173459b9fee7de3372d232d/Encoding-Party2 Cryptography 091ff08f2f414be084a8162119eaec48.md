- `EY is looking for cybersecurity enthusiasts.`

## Summary

- Here we get the following string:
    - `RL vf ybbxvat sbe plorefrphevgl raguhfvnfgf`
- Based on the fact that there are only letters, `caesar cipher` seems to be the one used here
- Using `cyberchef` again, with `ROT13` , which is caesar cipher with a shift of 13 characters will give us the flag
